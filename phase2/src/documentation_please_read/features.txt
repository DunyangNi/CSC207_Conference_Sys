Mandatory features:

1. Multiple types of events. We have three: Talk, Panel (Panel discussion) and Networking (Networking event).
You can see the difference between these three types when you create an event as an organizer.

2. Events can be canceled by organizers. You can see how it works as it is a new menu option for organizers.

3. At least one more type of user. We added one type, which is the VIP attendee who has access to Vip events.
You can see its effect by the inclusion of VIP restrictions in events and the VipRestrictedException.

4. Organizers can create any other type of user accounts in the program. You can see how it works since it is a
new menu option for organizers.

Optional/Original features:

HTML download (Optional): You are now able to download an html file which shows a table for all events with
relevant info. It is a new menu option for all account types in the program.

Event Constraints (Optional): We added constraints to events and characteristics of locations. For example,
tables, chairs, internet, sound system, etc. You can see the difference when you are creating new events as
an organizer or signing up to events as an attendee.

User Requests (Optional): We added requests and allowed attendees to send them while organizers can view and
resolve them. This can be seen from the new menu options for attendees and organizers.

Contact list (Original): We made contact lists where users are able to add each other and view their contact
lists. Additionally, we have introduced restrictions to messaging based on contact lists. To first start a new
conversation with someone, you must have added them as a contact. The recipient of that first message can still
reply to the sender without having as a contact though. Contacts are still asymmetrical. Additionally note that
conversations, in particular their ordered collection of messages between two users, is also
an extension from the phase 1 specifications.
