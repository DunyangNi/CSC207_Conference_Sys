**Factory Design Pattern**
- ViewFactory: using enums we can generate a view with one controller and presenter.
- EventFactory: using enums we can generate different Events with no worry about type-specific constructors

**Visitor Design Pattern**
- VipAttendee, Attendee: distinguish if an Attendee is VIP or not without typecasting.
- Event (and its subclasses): distinguish events by their types and obtain speakers of specific events without typecasting.
